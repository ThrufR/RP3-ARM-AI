# RP3-ARM-AI
Repository for Design Laboratory project concerning Ai object recogniction and servomotor robotic arm

Code team: Magdalena Pikul (pikulm), Jan Magiera (ThrufR)
Project consultant: Sebastian Koryciak

Milestone one:
-- TBI
Milestone two:
-- TBI
Milestone three:
-- TBI 

General idea of this project is to create software for Raspberry PI 3, to utilize digital camera and servomotor based robotic arm. Our goal is to implement AI for proper object recognition and object manipulation (within the limits of arm's field).

Updates to this file will be posted after claryfying objectives and milestones.
